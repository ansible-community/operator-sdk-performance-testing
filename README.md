# Operator SDK Performance Testing

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/operator-sdk-performance-testing/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/operator-sdk-performance-testing/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This repository contains some automation code to assist with performance testing for some aspects of the Kubernetes [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).

## Running the tests

  1. Install [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
  1. Install Python dependencies: `pip3 install molecule openshift docker`
  1. Run the benchmark with Molecule:

     ```
     OPERATOR_UNDER_TEST=ansible molecule test -s kind
     ```

You can set `OPERATOR_UNDER_TEST` to one of the following:

  - `ansible`
  - `go`
  - `helm`

It is best to run each benchmark individually, in a clean Kind cluster, instead of running one after the other, to ensure the benchmark is as accurate as possible.

### Running the tests on a generic Kubernetes cluster

The `kind` Molecule test scenario manages a Kind instance, but the `default` scenario works with any functional Kubernetes cluster, as long as you can connect to it with a working `KUBECONFIG` file.

As an example, you can run the tests against [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/):

  1. Start a Minikube instance: `minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 8g`
  2. By default, Minikube adds its configuration to `~/.kube/config`, but if you override that path, make sure to `export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/overridden/kubeconfig`.
  3. Run the benchmark with Molecule:

     ```
     OPERATOR_UNDER_TEST=ansible molecule test
     ```

### Running the tests on an EC2 instance

See https://github.com/geerlingguy/operator-sdk-performance-testing/issues/9

  1. `pip3 install molecule-ec2`

## How it works

The Ansible playbook in `main.yml` uses a Kind cluster set up by Molecule to build and deploy the `OPERATOR_UNDER_TEST` into the cluster.

Then the playbook deploys the amount of Memcached CRs defined by `memcached_cr_count` in `config.yml` into the cluster.

Immediately after that, the playbook waits for all the expected Memcached instances to be up and running.

At the end of the playbook, Ansible's `profile_tasks` callback plugin reports back the timings of all the tasks. You can use these timings to benchmark the operators against each other.
